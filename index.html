            <img src="img/learner.png" alt="Fast learner"/>
          </div>
          <h2>Fast learner</h2>
          <p>I like to push myself to go out and explore new grounds. Because of my quick learning ability I am capable of producing something that is up to standards fairly quickly. This made me into someone who will always try to impress his environment even though I haven't mastered it completely. For that reason I am confident that I can be employed in a lot of places.</p>

          <div class="image">
            <img src="img/timemanager.png" alt="Time manager"/>
          </div>
          <h2>Time manager</h2>
          <p>If I'm working on a project I always have a detailed to-do list in the back of my head. I know exactly which tasks should have the highest priority and which will take the most amount of time. One of my strongest points is that I can maintain an overview of all the tasks while focusing on the one I'm working on. <br/>Bonus: I'm always on time!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ability three" id="apeakperformer">
          <div class="image">
            <img src="img/peak.png" alt="Peak performer"/>
          </div>          
          <h2>Peak performer</h2>
          <p>Deadlines are great. From the moment I am forced to finish something in a certain time span, I know I will be at my best. The simplest solutions and the most elegant ideas come to me when I'm being put under (healthy) pressure. Since I love to show others what I am capable of, I developed a great sense of responsibility to always try to deliver my best work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ability three" id="apresenter">
          <div class="image">
            <img src="img/presenter.png" alt="presenter"/>
          </div>
          <h2>Presenter</h2>
          <p>As a certified teacher I experienced what it's like to talk to large audiences and how to address information in such a way that everyone understands. I learned that I am good at improvising and that I can quickly adapt to different audiences. I have proven to handle both a critical (e.g. professors) and an uninterested (e.g. adolescents) public very well.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ability three" id="aautodidact">
          <div class="image">
            <img src="img/autodidact.png" alt="Autodidact"/>
          </div>
          <h2>Autodidact</h2>
          <p>I am not someone who constantly needs to hold hands to learn something. Everything I know about web development I have learned through autodidactism. I know what it's like to jump in a completely new environment and work my way around one way or another. In college I learned to distill the core information first and to expand my knowledge from there.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ability three" id="ateamplayer">
          <div class="image">
            <img src="img/teamplayer.png" alt="Team player"/>
          </div>          
          <h2>Team player</h2>
          <p>I love to work in teams. I believe team work can make you a better professional since it is one of the few moments in your life you'll get to be criticised. Although I hate that people point out my bad parts, I always respect someones opinion. As a soccer player I know what it's like to know your place in a team and to do your best in function of the group.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ability three" id="aideabringer">
          <div class="image">
            <img src="img/ideas.png" alt="Idea bringer"/>
          </div>
          <h2>Idea bringer</h2>
          <p>I am constantly thinking about possible improvements and try to reason why things are the way they are. It causes me to always have more ideas then I got time to work on them. Mostly it comes down to making the right choices. Balancing between idealistic and realistic is what I do best and for that reason I believe I can be an added value to any team.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ability three" id="aproblemsolver">
          <div class="image">
            <img src="img/paperclip.png" alt="Problem solver"/>
          </div>
          <h2>Problem solver</h2>
          <p>Only recently I started to learn how to program and I love it. Programming for me is not about executing ideas, it's about solving problems. As you are writing an application you constantly bump into new problems which could mean you have to rewrite half of your code base. I find it very satisfying if I can find the most elegant solution to a very difficult problem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ability three" id="acuriousgeorge">
          <div class="image">
            <img src="img/curious.png" alt="Curious George"/>
          </div>          
          <h2>Curious George</h2>
          <p>The constant need to try and find out how stuff works is embedded in my genes. I have always been curious about how computers work. And the more I found out about them, the more I got interested until I got to the level of building websites and applications. I've got the feeling I have only seen the tip of the iceberg and I'm very eager to find out what's beneath.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ability three" id="amrflexible">
          <div class="image">
            <img src="img/flexible.png" alt="Mr. flexible"/>
          </div>
          <h2>Mr. flexible</h2>
          <p>Nobody has ever portrayed me as a dictator who wants to do it his way or the high way. I like to exert influence on someones opinion but I am also very indulgent and willing to cooperate on another one's idea. I am easy to work with and I never pick a quarrel just to prove my point. For that reason I have never found it difficult to join an existing team.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ability three" id="aperfectionist">
          <div class="image">
            <img src="img/perfect.png" alt="Perfectionist"/>
          </div>
          <h2>Perfectionist</h2>
          <p>I am my worst critic. Before I have even start working on something I already found out what will and what won't be good about it. My habit of remarking little details on everything (e.g. "that restaurants logo needs better kerning") hasn't improved my social life but definitely made me more conscious in my professional life. I am what you could call a "fusspot".</p>
        </div>

          </div>          
          <h2>Mystery</h2>
          <p>Tomorrow is a mystery. Every year or so I found out more about myself. Of all the listed characteristics there are probably twice as much I still have to find out. I think it is one my strongest points to be able to adapt and improve drastically over a short period. Therefor I believe I have got a lot of potential to become a renowned person in the business.</p>

          <p>In the summer of 2011, a <a href="http://www.jefvlamings.com/avn">local sports club</a> asked me to do a redesign of their website. I concluded that they needed a CMS to provide content, so I build a WordPress based website from ground up. A lot of time went in the design process to try and match the atmosphere of the club with the look and feel of the website. This project involved the use of Photoshop, Illustrator, Google Maps API, Wordpress and CSS3</p>

          <p>In 2011 I <a href="http://www.jefvlamings.com/blog/" title="My blog">started blogging</a> about my experiences in web development. Although I am not a frequent blogger, I'm getting quite a lot of attention from fellow developers. Some of my posts did very well and got shared over 6000 times. Because of the warm reactions from the web community I wish to continue blogging for many years.</p>

If the football season is over, I tend to go out and run some miles to stay in shape. Besides football I'm pretty much open to any sport as long it has some action and competitiveness.</p>

          <p>A few years ago I developed a passion for traveling. I love to go out and explore new countries and cultures. For me traveling is about discovering beauty and submerging yourself in other cultures. As I'm not the type to travel for very long periods I try to compensate it with shorter higher quality trips to try to achieve the same level of experience.</p>
